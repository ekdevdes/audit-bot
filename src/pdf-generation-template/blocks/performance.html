            <p>Estimated Input Latency</p>
            <p>The score above is an estimate of how long your app takes to respond to user input, in milliseconds There is a 90% probability that a user encounters this amount of latency, or less. 10% of the time a user can expect additional latency. If your latency is higher than 50 ms, users may perceive your app as laggy. (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/estimated-input-latency).</p>
