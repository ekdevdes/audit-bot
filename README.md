 [![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/ekdevdes/audit-bot/badge.svg?style=flat-square)](https://snyk.io/test/github/ekdevdes/audit-bot)

A bot to audit the performance, best practices, accessiblity, SEO, PWA and security of your site. You can set it up so that it only runs on a few of the categories and only fails your PR based on unmet requirements that you specify. 

More info coming soon.
